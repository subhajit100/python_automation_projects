### Below are the projects

 1. **CSV extractor project**:- In this I have taken a csv file as input and extracted a new csv with lesser columns and rows. I have also plotted a bar chart with the data from new csv. <br>

 2. **Folder cleaner project**:- In this I have taken a folder path which I want to organize. As a part of the script, we will be creating four new folders:- Images, Docs, Audio and Videos. We will also be running the script in an infinite loop and will be watchdogging for any modifications or adding of new files in the folder path. If it does, then the organizeFiles method is triggered to clean the stuff. <br>
 Don't forget to press Ctrl+C when you want to stop the program. <br>
